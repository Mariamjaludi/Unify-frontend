      Which university should you apply to? There are over 150 institutions in the UK offering different experiences, courses and extra-curricular opportunities. Your task is to find the university, or universities, to apply to via UCAS. This is achieved by establishing which universities meet your preferences in relating to factors such as course provision, teaching style, location, type of university and extra-curricular opportunities.
